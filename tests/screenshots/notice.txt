.dae files does not support curves, so they miss the ground.

while parsing .dae and .obj file with assimp, it creates dummy childs to perform transformations,
this breaks the inner working of physics generation, since it's based on node names.


The light intensity is different for each format parsed, because assimp returns it that way.
radius is ignored. Power seems to decide color for the light, 
in a strange format that is not the color.

(from blender 20W, specular 1, radius .5):

* gltf lot brighter:
		a{20,20,20} 	d{20,20,20} 	s{20,20,20}, 	clq= 0 0 1 

* dae lot brighter:
		a{0,0,0} 	d{20,20,20} 	s{20,20,20}, 	clq= 1 0 0

* fbx lot dimmer:
		a{0,0,0} 	d{20,20,20} 	s{20,20,20}, 	clq= 0 0 3.2*10^(-7)


* obj DOES NOT SUPPORT LIGHTS
